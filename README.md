# PyNeuralStyle
This repository contains the code for the paper: A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style by LA Gatys et al. 

The data was downloaded from [here](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style). 

Run the code:  
`python main.py --ip_img /path/to/image --art_img /path/to/artwork --img_sz 1024`
The image size can be set to your desired output image size, however the output is a square image of `img_sz x img_sz`. 

Potential future work:
- Merge different artistic styles in one image.
